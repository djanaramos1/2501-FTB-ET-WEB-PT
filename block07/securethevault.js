//Create a html and js page
//Link the pages together
//Create a string for the user saying You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination: 121
//Assign three variables
//create three unique arithmetic operator
//Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process
//Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog

alert(

  );
  //This code gives the user an alert when coming to the page. It is a statement and ends with a semicolon
  
  let myVariable = 10*1;
  console.log(myVariable);
  //Expected output is 10 because 10 multiplied by 1 equals 10
  
  let num = 25 + 15
  console.log(num);
  //Expected output is 40
  
  let strg1= 5;
  let strg2= 25;
  let strg3= 9;
  console.log(strg1 + strg2 + strg3)
  //Expected output is 39 because the value of the three strings are added equaling 39
